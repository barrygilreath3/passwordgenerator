# JavaScript: Password Generator

## My Task

In this project, I was given starter code to modify and create an application that generates random passwords based upon user-selected criteria.

## User Story I Was Assigned

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Comments
I am new to learning JavaScript and was not able to get the program to run.  It was not for lack of effort, as I spent 15+ hours over the course of 3 days building what is seen in the first commit (3/25/2022).

Update (3/30)/2022):  I received help from a tutor who helped me clean up and correct my code which overly complicated.  The app is now functional.
